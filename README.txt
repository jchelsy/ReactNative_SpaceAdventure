In regards to:
'metro.config.js'  and  'app.json'

......

Both of these files have been modified by me, which is why I included it in the Source Code.

The SVG library required the 'metro.config.js' file, as well as the addition of content inside the 'app.json' file.


The last value in 'app.json' is what was added.
("packagerOpts" and its child elements)
